# Python-Sequence-Skew-Analyzer
Developed a Python pipeline to analyze DNA sequences, computing GC content, GC skew, and AT skew across sliding windows.  Visualized nucleotide composition trends using matplotlib for genomic pattern exploration.  Demonstrated skills in Python programming, bioinformatics sequence analysis, and data visualization.

# 🧬 DNA GC/AT Skew Analyzer
# Overview
This project implements a Python-based genomic sequence analysis pipeline that computes:
- GC Content (sliding window)
- GC Skew: (G − C) / (G + C)
- AT Skew: (A − T) / (A + T)
The script visualizes nucleotide composition trends across a DNA sequence using matplotlib.

# Biological Significance
GC and AT skew analysis is commonly used in:
- Identifying replication origins
- Detecting strand bias
- Exploring genomic asymmetry
- Comparative genomics studies

# Features
- Sliding window analysis
- Handles divide-by-zero cases
- Publication-ready plots
- Modular function design
- Easily extendable to FASTA inputs
# Technologies Used
- Python 3
- matplotlib
- Standard library

  # Output
